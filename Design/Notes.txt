Making Wireframe Material
-------------------------
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTWYqHb6Aw 
- New Material
- In material editor:
  - Details > Material > Wireframe: false
  - Details > Material > Blend Mode: Masked
- See my material M_NeonWire for blueprint nodes
- Can preview steps of material by right clicking node and "Start Previewing"
- For max node set b to 0
- Using ObjectPositionWS and World Position which is absolute
- If we want to have black instead of transparent, don't have a masked blend mode and connect dot product to color with multiply into emissive
  - Otherwise attach to opacity mask instead
  - Make sure unlit if you want it to be black and not reflecting 

Importing Hands
---------------
- Open project with hands (such as oculus sample)
  - C:\Dev\UE4Source\Oculus424\UnrealEngine\Samples\Oculus\HandSample
- Select the Blueprint Utils, VRCharacter and NewGameMode
- Asset Actions > Migrate
- Migrate to a content folder !!!IMPORTANT!!! then move to some other folder
- In the sample project, make sure to copy info in the Level blueprint over to our level blueprint
  - May need to replace references to VRCharacter casting and getting controller / hand from the casting
  - Make sure in VRCharacter to open blueprint and set either the controller or hand to not be visible
- Update the Project Settings > Maps and Modes to use our NewGameMode/VRGameMode
- Copy the controller bindings over from the config folder DefaultInput.ini (or map whatever we want to)
